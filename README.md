# weather-dashboard

udsed both current weather api and opencall api even though they share some data. current weather api allows a name to be entered into the url while uvindex and opencall require longitude and latitude, so i used current weather to fetch the lon and lat. becuase it was redundant, the current section was excluded from the api fetch in opencall
